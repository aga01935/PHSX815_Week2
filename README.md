# PHSX_Week2
## Repo for the Homwerk 2 of week 2

Random.py generates random numbers
### Homework 3
We can generate random numbers by calling one of the method present in the code.
<br> Parabolic_Dist.py calls the Random Class from file Random.py and use methode named parabolic_dist to produce probabilitistic distribution parabolic function y = ax^2.
<br>Which will create a file named parabola.png containing the distribution.
### Homework 4
Files used in week 2 homework are:
- CookieAnalysis.py
- CookieTimer.py
- MySort.py
- Random.py
<br> We produced the cookie_experiment.txt is produced using command
<br> "python3 CookieTimer.py -rate 4 -Nexp 100000 -Nmeas 10 -output cookie_experiment.txt"
<br> Time_Average.png  and Time.png are the resulted plot using CookieAnalysis.py
<br> "python3 CookieAnalysis.py  cookie_experiment.txt"
